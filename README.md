# CSE215 - Object Oriented Programming with Java

This repository contains coursework and projects completed during the **CSE215: Object Oriented Programming** class under the guidance of the honorable **SVA Ma'am**, whose teaching made the fundamentals and advanced concepts of OOP in Java crystal clear.

## Course Overview

This course introduces the foundational concepts and techniques of **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Students learn to construct actual computer programs by applying OOP principles and using **Java** as the programming language. The primary topics covered include:

- **Java Syntax and Elementary Programming:** 
  - Primitive data types, strings, and operators.
  - Control flow statements.

- **Methods and Arrays:** 
  - Function definition and calling.
  - Array manipulation and use in Java.

- **Introduction to OOP:**
  - Classes, objects, and constructors.
  - Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- **Advanced OOP Concepts:**
  - Abstract classes and interfaces.
  - Generics and type parameters.

- **File I/O Operations:**
  - Reading from and writing to files in Java.

- **Exception Handling:**
  - Managing errors and exceptions in Java programs.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
  - Basic GUI development using Java.

- **Multithreading:** 
  - Implementing concurrent programming in Java.

## Course Projects

This repository showcases various projects and assignments that demonstrate the application of the above topics, providing practical insights into how OOP concepts are used in real-world programming.

## Technologies Used
